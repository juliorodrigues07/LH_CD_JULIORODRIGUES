# 3. Execution

1. Clone the repository

       git clone -b deploy https://github.com/juliorodrigues07/ny_rent_pricing.git

2. Enter the repository's directory

       cd ny_rent_pricing

2. Create a virtual environment

       python3 -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment

       source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies

       pip install -r requirements.txt

5. You first need to be in the _dashboards_ directory and  then to run the command:
     
       streamlit run 1_üè†_Home.py

# 4. Project Structure

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Project's documentation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                # File containing all the required dependencies to run the project
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets                          # Directory containing images used in README.md and in the deployed app
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboards                      # Directory containing the web application
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_üè†_Home.py                <- Main page with the price predictor
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages                       # Child pages directory
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_üìà_Interactive.py     <- Script responsible for generating the interactive dashboards
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_üìä_Static.py          <- Script responsible for generating the static dashboards

# 5. Outro

- To uninstall all dependencies, run the following command:

      pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

- To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:

      deactivate

- To delete the virtual environment, run the following command:

      rm -rf .venv
